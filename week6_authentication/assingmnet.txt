Perfect idea 🔥 — that’s exactly how you’ll make it stick.
Here’s a small practical assignment based on your JWT authentication system — designed for quick revision + practice.

🧠 Assignment: JWT Auth + Protected Routes (Mini Project)
🎯 Goal

Build a simple Express server with:

user signup

user login (returns JWT)

2 protected routes that only work if token is valid

📋 Requirements

Signup Route (POST /signup)

Accepts username and password

Checks if username already exists

Saves user (in-memory array)

Responds with "Signup successful"

Signin Route (POST /signin)

Accepts username and password

If valid, generate JWT (jwt.sign())

Responds with { token: "<JWT_TOKEN>" }

Token should expire in 2 minutes (expiresIn: "2m")

Protected Routes

GET /profile: returns user info (from JWT)

GET /dashboard: returns message "Welcome <username> to your dashboard!"

Both should:

Read token from Authorization header

Verify with jwt.verify()

If invalid or expired → return 403 with "Invalid or expired token"
