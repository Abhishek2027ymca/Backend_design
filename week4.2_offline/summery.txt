__dirname → path of the folder where your JS file runs.

Relative paths (like ./files) are based on __dirname.

Node only reads files from the directory you specify — not the whole system.

Express can’t access C:/ or other folders unless you explicitly allow it.

Project structure decides what’s readable (e.g., files inside ./files/).

Use console.log(__dirname) to check where Node is reading from.
